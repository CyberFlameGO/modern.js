# BFF

In the development of the concept of **front back separation**, the front-end part can do more and more things, and the front-end needs some UI-oriented data interfaces, so the industry introduced the concept of BFF (Backends for Frontends).

The main problems it to solve include:

- Aggregate, map, tailor, and proxy back-end interfaces according to customer's service requirements.
- Cache data for some specific scenarios to improve performance and thus improve user experience.
- Rapid development of new applications based on existing interfaces.
- Interface with third-party systems, such as login authentication.

Modern.js supports BFF and provides an integrated BFF scheme to further enhance BFF capabilities, including the following:

- Quick development and debugging go live, running, building, and deploying BFF code in the same project.
- Minimal pure function call, directly import BFF function on the front end, and can be automatically converted into HTTP request when called.
- No private protocol, follow RESTful API specification, all BFF interfaces are standardized.
- Full TypeScript support.
- Satisfy user preferences and support multi-framework extensions for writing.
